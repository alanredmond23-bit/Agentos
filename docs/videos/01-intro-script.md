## Metadata

- **Duration:** 3 minutes
- **Audience:** All levels (executives, developers, operators)
- **Prerequisites:** None
- **Goal:** Understand what AgentOS is and why it matters

---

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:20)

**Visuals:** Animated logo reveal, then montage of AI agents working: code being written, marketing campaigns launching, database schemas updating.

**Narration:**
"AI agents are transforming how teams build software. But deploying them at scale? That is where things get complicated. Enter AgentOS: the open-source operating system for AI agent orchestration."

**Actions:** None (animated sequence)

---

### Scene 2: The Problem (0:20 - 0:50)

**Visuals:** Split screen showing chaos: multiple terminal windows, error logs, confused developer.

**Narration:**
"Without proper infrastructure, AI agents become unpredictable. They might access data they should not, run up massive API bills, or make changes without approval. Enterprise teams need guardrails, not chaos."

**Actions:** Show quick flashes of:
- Agent accessing PII (with red warning overlay)
- Cost meter spinning up rapidly
- Production database being modified without approval

---

### Scene 3: The Solution (0:50 - 1:30)

**Visuals:** Clean AgentOS architecture diagram animating in layer by layer.

**Narration:**
"AgentOS solves this with three core layers. First, Agent Packs: domain-specific collections of agents for Product, Marketing, Engineering, and more. Second, the Runtime Engine: handling orchestration, routing, and policy enforcement. Third, the Ops Console: giving you real-time visibility, approvals, and emergency controls."

**Actions:** As each layer is mentioned, it highlights on the diagram:
1. Bottom layer: Agent Packs icons appear
2. Middle layer: Runtime Engine components animate in
3. Top layer: Ops Console dashboard preview slides in

---

### Scene 4: Key Features (1:30 - 2:15)

**Visuals:** Quick feature montage with icons and brief demos.

**Narration:**
"With AgentOS, you get enterprise-grade security: automatic PII redaction, secret rotation, and webhook replay defense. You get governance: quality gates, human approvals for high-risk actions, and comprehensive audit logging. You get multi-model routing: seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek based on task requirements. And you get observability: real-time dashboards, cost tracking, and anomaly detection."

**Actions:** Show brief 2-3 second clips of:
- PII being automatically masked in logs
- Approval request in Ops Console
- Model router selecting provider
- Dashboard with live metrics

---

### Scene 5: Who Uses AgentOS (2:15 - 2:40)

**Visuals:** Icons representing different roles with use case text.

**Narration:**
"AgentOS is built for teams who need production-ready AI agents. Product teams use it to generate PRDs and specs. Marketing teams run compliant SMS campaigns. Engineering teams automate code review and deployment. DevOps teams manage infrastructure safely. All with enterprise controls built in."

**Actions:** Show icons for each role with their pack highlighted

---

### Scene 6: Call to Action (2:40 - 3:00)

**Visuals:** Terminal showing clone command, then final logo card.

**Narration:**
"Ready to get started? Clone the repository, run the bootstrap script, and you will have a working AgentOS environment in under five minutes. Check out our quick start video next, or dive into the documentation at docs.agentos.dev."

**Actions:**
- Show terminal with: `git clone https://github.com/alanredmond23-bit/Agentos.git`
- Fade to logo with links overlay
